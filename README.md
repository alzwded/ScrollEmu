ScrollEmu
=========

Context: I have a logitech trackball with a horrible scroll wheel implementation -- two horrible scroll implementations to be exact.

So I've put this together which allows me to lean down on button #5 and then use the whole ball to send vertical _and_ horizontal scroll events (giant scroll wheel, yay!!)

Now that I'm getting ready to push this, I realized I've implemented natural scrolling by accident. Whoops. That will need to be fixed.

TODO:
* toggle between natural and traditional scrolling
* mappable "hotkey" to either X buttons or have a keyboard modifier like scroll lock/winkey
