ScrollEmu
=========

Context: I have a logitech trackball with a horrible scroll wheel implementation -- two horrible scroll implementations to be exact.

So I've put this together which allows me to lean on button #5 and then use the whole wheel to sent vertical and horizontal scroll events (giant scroll wheel!)

Now that I'm getting ready to push this, I realized I've implemented natural scrolling by accident. Whops.

TODO:
* proper title for the window
* toggle between natural and traditional scrolling
* mappable "hotkey"
